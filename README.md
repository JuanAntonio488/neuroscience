# Python packages

[PyMVPA](http://www.pymvpa.org/) is a Python package intended to ease statistical learning analyses of large datasets.

[BioSPPY](https://github.com/PIA-Group/BioSPPy) a toolbox for biosignal processing written in Python.

[BCIkit](https://github.com/octopicorn/bcikit). Toolkit and workbench for BCI software development, for Python.

[OpenNFB](https://github.com/strfry/OpenNFB). A Neurofeedback software approach based on Python and Qt5/pyqtgraph It is ment for programmers, because it does not try to provide a visual programming language, like BrainBay/BioEra/BioExplorer, so it is only sutable for those who do not fear source code and the command line.

[MNE](https://mne.tools/stable/index.html).Open-source Python software for exploring, visualizing, and analyzing human neurophysiological data: MEG, EEG, sEEG, ECoG, and more.

[EEGrunt](https://github.com/curiositry/EEGrunt). A Collection Python EEG (+ ECG) Analysis Utilities for OpenBCI and Muse.


# Datasets

[Here is a list of publicly available brain signals data](http://www.brainsignals.de/)

# Data analysis competitions

[BCI competitions](http://bbci.de/competition/)
[Review of the BCI competition IV](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2012.00055/full). The BCI competition IV stands in the tradition of prior BCI competitions that aim to provide high quality neuroscientific data for open access to the scientific community. As experienced already in prior competitions not only scientists from the narrow field of BCI compete, but scholars with a broad variety of backgrounds and nationalities. They include high specialists as well as students. The goals of all BCI competitions have always been to challenge with respect to novel paradigms and complex data. We report on the following challenges: (1) asynchronous data, (2) synthetic, (3) multi-class continuous data, (4) session-to-session transfer, (5) directionally modulated MEG, (6) finger movements recorded by ECoG. As after past competitions, our hope is that winning entries may enhance the analysis methods of future BCIs.
